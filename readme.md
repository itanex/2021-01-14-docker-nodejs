Tutorial : [VSCode Docs - Build and Run NodeJS in a Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/containers/quickstart-node)

## What I learned

Initial experience in setting up a project that will be using Express and NodeJS that will be hosted in a Docker Container. The tutorial goes through and teaches the basic starting process using the Command Palette of VSCode. 

* Initializing a basic NodeJS/Express project
* Using the command palette to add Docker files to project
* Running the NodeJS locally
* Building the Docker image using the command palette
* Running the newly built Docker image(service container)
* Attaching the Debugger to the container executing code and debugging
* Where to find the container logs

## Next step(s)

* Practice these steps to understand the workflow
